### Overview

This project focuses on **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** and its **Sim2Real (simulation-to-reality) transfer**.  
The goal is to enable cooperative and competitive agents trained in simulation environments to generalize effectively to real-world settings.

We explore questions such as:
- How to achieve **robust coordination** among multiple agents in dynamic, partially observable environments.
- How to design **policy architectures and training curricula** that facilitate transfer from simulation to physical systems.
- How domain randomization, adaptation, and representation learning can mitigate the Sim2Real gap.

### Key Topics
- Decentralized training with centralized critics  
- Robust policy transfer and domain adaptation  
- Multi-robot collaboration and swarm intelligence  
- Benchmarking in simulated and real-world robotic tasks
