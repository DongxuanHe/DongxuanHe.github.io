I am excited to share that I have joined the **Institute for Control, Optimization, and Networks (ICON)** at **Purdue University** as a **Master’s student in Robotics**.  

My research will focus on the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Robotics**, including topics such as **visual SLAM**, **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, and **Sim2Real transfer**. I’m particularly interested in building learning-based perception and control systems that bridge the gap between simulation and real-world robotics.
