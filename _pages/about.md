Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a **Robotics** masterâ€™s student at Purdue University, working under the Institute for Control, Optimization, and Networks (ICON). I earned my B.S. in **Computer Science** with a minor in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue in three years.

My current research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Robotics systems, with a focus on Visual SLAM, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, and Sim2Real transfer. Iâ€™m particularly interested in building learning-based localization pipelines and adaptive control systems that bridge the gap between simulation and the real world.

Iâ€™m passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Robotics**, especially how learning-based methods can enable robots to perceive, adapt, and act intelligently in complex environments â€” from data-driven perception and sensor fusion to policy transfer and decision-making in dynamic real-world settings.
